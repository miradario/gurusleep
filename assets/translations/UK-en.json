        "Q8":"Why is it beneficial to do breathing techniques and not just mindfulness exercises? ",
        "R8":"Breathing exercises help us relax. The breath is closely connected to our vegetative (or autonomous) nervous system which controls and regulates organs and organ systems and controls the alternation between tension and relaxation in the human organism. In fact, breathing is the only way for humans to consciously exert influence on the autonomous nervous system. If we breathe long and deep the vagus nerve (part of the autonomic nervous system) is stimulated, which has a calming effect as heart rate and blood pressure drop and muscles relax.\n Hence, conscious breathing is a powerful mechanism to stay calm and focused while anchoring our mind in the present moment.\n Research shows conscious breathing has a profound healing impact on our physiology, and it is one of the simplest ways to reset.  Pausing to take a few deep breaths can allow us to let go of the negative thoughts, have a deeper experience of mindfulness and enter the next activity or interaction with fresh eyes, energy, and enthusiasm.\n",
        "Q9":"What are the benefits of mindfulness exercises?",
        "R9":"Benefits of mindfulness are innumerable. According to research, mindfulness exercises help:\n\n  Reduce stress\n Improve memory\n Reduce depressive thoughts\n Improve focus\n Better relationship satisfaction\n Decrease rumination\n Decrease anxiety\n Improve sleep quality\n Improve empathy and compassion\n Contribute to overall improvement in quality of life \n\n Meditation practice can even change the structure of the brain, as shown by a team of researchers from the University of Giessen, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The research team found out that the 8-week practice of meditation causes changes in the grey matter density of the brain, specifically in brain regions which are responsible for stress reactions, empathy, self-perception and memory.\n",
